# ASX Announcements Viewer

This is a simple Streamlit app that allows users to view recent announcements for selected ticker symbols from the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). The announcements are pre-loaded from a local JSON file, and the app provides an option to filter by ticker symbols and also highlights tickers with "Trading Halt" announcements.
